# The Importance of Data Normalization (Scaling)

### Thanks for your interest in this lesson

Normalizing - or scaling - your data before running it through a classifier is essential. It brings all variables to the same scale, and avoids that features with large values dominate the calculations.

This is particularly important for classifiers that rely on the Eucliean distance to do its magic. Also, clustering algorithms can benefit equaly from data scaling.

To run the examples, just hit:

`python3 KNN_no_scaling.py example_dataset_unscaled.csv`

And it should work. Also, it is the same process for the other sripts.
